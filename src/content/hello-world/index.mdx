Hello World! Classic.

I decided to make a blog to write down some of the learning I make in my personal projects over on my [Github](https://github.com/alex-r89).

Some of these projects are private, so not all of the learnings will relate to visible projects.

I'll also post some random ramblings maybe, im not sure.
